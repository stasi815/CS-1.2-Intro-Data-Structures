If you look inside your bags you will find a few things
A bouquet of hand-crocheted flower pens Oh A mosaic portrait of each of you made from the crushed bottles of your favorite diet soda and a personalized of why you are all so awesome
What's Galentine's Day Oh it's only the best day of the year
Every February 13th my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home and we just come and kick it breakfast style
Ladies celebrating ladies
It's like Lilith Fair minus the angst
Plus frittatas
So to conclude our Galentine's Day breakfast it is time for the greatest story ever told
What's the story It's the most romantic story ever
It makes The Notebook look like Saw V
Go Mom go
It was 1968
I was 18 and our family went on a vacation to Bermuda
And on the first day I went for a swim in the ocean
And I got caught in a very strong current
You've heard this story before right Yes but the drama
The next thing I felt were two very powerful arms whisking me to safety
And he looked down at me and he said Are you okay And I looked up at him and I said I am now
 So they sneak out to meet each other and walk on the beach
And two weeks later he asked her to marry him and move to Illinois
But her parents thought she was too young so she said no
And then they lost touch and a few years later she met my dad
I gotta take one of those lifeguard courses
Those guys get all the action
Am I right Justin We gotta find this guy
Frank He's probably married or dead
What's the difference Am I right Justin Well at least let me try and find him
Imagine how much better that story would be if we actually reunited them I think Justin's right
You should let him do this
Okay
Do it
